# Freely Available Gruntwork Script Modules

This folder contains Gruntwork Script Modules that are commonly used and made freely available.

### What's a Gruntwork Script Module?

A Gruntwork Script Module is a package of one or more bash scripts and/or binaries maintained by Gruntwork that are meant to be 
reusable in many different contexts. For example, we have Script Modules for installing a CloudWatch Logs agent, optimizing
syslog settings, setting up automatic security updates, and more. 

Our Script Modules are contained in the `modules/` folder of different GitHub repos since they often come with the 
different [Infrastructure Packages](https://blog.gruntwork.io/gruntwork-infrastructure-packages-7434dc77d0b1#.6bwor6wxc) 
we sell.
